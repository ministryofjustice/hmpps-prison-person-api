## Building

To use the same version of Java locally as is used in CI and production, follow [these notes](sdkman.md).


Firstly build the project (without tests) by running:
```
./gradlew clean build -x test
```

To rebuild the docker image locally after building the project (perhaps after some new changes), run:
```
docker build -t quay.io/hmpps/hmpps-prison-person-api:latest .
```

## Testing
```
./gradlew test 
```

## Running

The service can be run in the following ways:

### Running in the command line with gradle
```
./gradlew bootRun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev'
```

### Running in IntelliJ
Run the main class with the following VM options:
```
-Dspring.profiles.active=dev
```

In both of the above sections, `dev` can be replaced with `dev-postgres` to run against the postgres docker container
instead of h2.

### Running with docker-compose
```
docker-compose up
```

## Common gradle tasks

To list project dependencies, run:

```
./gradlew dependencies
```

To check for dependency updates, run:
```
./gradlew dependencyUpdates --warning-mode all
```

To run an OWASP dependency check, run:
```
./gradlew clean dependencyCheckAnalyze --info
```

To upgrade the gradle wrapper version, run:
```
./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=<VERSION>
```

To automatically update project dependencies, run:
```
./gradlew useLatestVersions
```

#### Ktlint Gradle Tasks

To run Ktlint check:
```
./gradlew ktlintCheck
```

To run Ktlint format:
```
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```

To register pre-commit check to run Ktlint format:
```
./gradlew addKtlintFormatGitPreCommitHook 
```

...or to register pre-commit check to only run Ktlint check:
```
./gradlew addKtlintCheckGitPreCommitHook
```
